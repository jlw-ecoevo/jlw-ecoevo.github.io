The lab opens in January 2023 and I will be recruiting students and postdocs after that. 
I currently have funding for:

 - One postdoc 3-year to start summer 2023 (this is a research-only postdoc but also see teaching postdoc opportuinity below)
 - Undergraduates to work over the summer, and potentially during the semester

I am also excited to recruit additional postdocs through Chapman's teaching postdoc fellowship program through their [Grand Challenges Initiative](https://www.chapman.edu/about/our-home/keck-center/gci/index.aspx) (three year positions with a 30%/70% teaching/research split). The application for this should open up towards the end of the year.
 
As 2023 approaches, I will post actual ads for the postdoc position, but
please feel free to reach out to me before then if you would like to discuss projects
and mentorship style and fit. 

Please also read over my mentorship philosophy and our lab code of conduct on the [Lab Stuff](https://jlw-ecoevo.github.io/lab.html) page
to determine whether this lab might be a good fit for you.

## Postdocs

I will be recruiting **one postdoc to start summer 2023 for a position currently funded for three years (until summer 2026)**. I will post a more official ad in the coming months, but this is a pretty flexible position in terms of projects because you will be funded directly off my startup (not beholden to the aims of any specific grant). I have lots of ideas for projects I think would be fun to collaborate on (many part of ongoing collaborations with researchers outside the lab), but I am also happy to hear your ideas if there are projects you are excited to bring to the group.

Chapman is an R2 institution with a very research active biology faculty, but (currently) no biology graduate programs. The level of undergraduate involvement in my lab is anticipated to be high, and I will be recruiting postdocs first and foremost on their interest in and demonstrated history of mentorship. I want us to have fun working on interesting science together, but my priority, especially with these initial hires, will be to foster a collaborative and supportive lab community for scientists at all stages in their careers. Please consider this when determining if this lab is the right fit for you. If you are someone who wants to work totally independently and is not interested in mentoring any students (which is a totally OK way to be) this position might not be a great fit. If you are excited about mentorship in addition to research, this might be the right place for you. Note that mentorship load will be flexible to your capacity (I anticipate a summer student or two per senior lab member, with the possibility of having a student work with you during the semester as well - quality mentorship over quantity).

If you are particularly excited about teaching in addition to research and mentorship, Chapman has a very cool **teaching postdoc fellowship program through their [Grand Challenges Initiative](https://www.chapman.edu/about/our-home/keck-center/gci/index.aspx)** where postdocs lead first and second year students through a research-project focused class. These are **three year positions with a 30%/70% teaching/research split**. I would be very happy to mentor fellows through this program, and I encourage you to reach out if this is something you are interested in.

I am also always more than happy to work with potential postdocs in developing fellowship applications relevant to our lab. [This](https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/postdoctoral/) is one good resource for finding fellowships.

## Masters Students

I do not currently have funding allocated for any Masters students, though I am in theory able to recruit students through Chapman's [computational and data sciences masters program](https://www.chapman.edu/scst/graduate/phd-computational-science.aspx). If you are interested in working with me and have your own sources of funding, please feel free to reach out.

## PhD Students

I do not currently have funding allocated for any PhD students, though I am in theory able to recruit students through Chapman's [computational and data sciences PhD program](https://www.chapman.edu/scst/graduate/phd-computational-science.aspx). If you are interested in working with me and have your own sources of funding, please feel free to reach out.

## Undergraduate Students

Did you think some of the stuff on this website was interesting? Consider joining the lab! We are a computational biology lab but **no experience in computational biology or coding is required** to join the lab. If you are enthusiastic about learning about these topics, we can train you. I firmly believe anyone can be a great computational biologist. Most of the students I have worked with in the past started out with absolutely zero coding experience, but quickly learned with hands-on training and a cool question in front of them. I am happy to have biologists, environmental scientists, computer scientists, and mathematicians join the lab (and even people from totally different fields if computational biology has caught your eye).

All summer students who work with me will be paid (I will not take unpaid volunteers). Unfortunately, this may limit available positions. Depending on the summer I may have funding to pay one or more students to work with me. Otherwise, I encourage you to apply for the [SURF program](https://www.chapman.edu/research/center-for-undergraduate-excellence/surf-program.aspx) and I am happy to discuss possible projects with you beforehand.
