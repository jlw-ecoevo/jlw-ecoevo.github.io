## Policy & Advocacy in Institutions of Highter Education

We are committed as a lab to improving working conditions within academic institutions, particularly for individuals coming from historically marginalized groups in science. JL previous worked to build research development infrastructure at CCNY to support their diverse student, staff, and faculty populations. They also are a founding member and core facilitator of [Advancing Queer and Trans Equity in Science (AQTES)](http://aqtes.org/), an international working group of queer and trans scientists advocating for specific policy changes at academic institutions, specifically through the publication of comprehensive best-practices.
